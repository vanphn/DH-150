							<h1>A sense of home </h1>
							<p>As humans, our senses are a powerful tool that can evoke specific memories from our past. Similarly, descriptions of places paired with existing memories can also trigger a sensory response, sometimes thought of as “deja vu.” With this digital project, I hope that my cultural recollection and exploration of Vietnam through the 5 senses can provide you with a window into my own experience.</p>

							<p>About two years ago, when I went back to visit my family in Vietnam, I was surprised to see how much it had changed since I left my home country 12 years ago. Even though the capital city of Vietnam where I’m from is loud and bustling, the village that my mother lived in is more quiet and tranquil, but has a distinctly different atmosphere than, say, the countryside in Wisconsin. In attempting to recreate this ambiance, I skimmed through old pictures that I had taken to pull memories and put myself back into the place I had visited years before, focusing primarily on what I can hear, smell, taste, and feel. I then searched for audio clips on youtube that most closely resembled these specific fragments of my memories. For example, the sound of rain must be soft and quiet as it falls, since the roads were made of dirt and the surrounding was covered in thick foliage.</p>
							<p>The specific scene that I am recreating is of my experience walking back to my mother’s childhood home after church. The air is slightly cold yet humid as it usually is in December. Although some of the sounds are constant, such as the passing wind or the cicadas, the setting is dynamic; There are people walking on the soft dirt and motorbikes driving by. When you listen to the sound, try to imagine the sound of thunder as the wind starts to pick up, clouds move across the sky, and the weather changes from misty to light rain. I encourage you to listen to this audio clip with headphones. Close your eyes and try to conjure other senses from the sound alone. </p>

							<p>When walking down the night market in Vietnam, you can hear the street vendors setting up different food booths. The flavor profile of Vietnamese foods are often sweet, salty, sour, and hot, focusing less on oils and dairy and more on the natural taste of herbs and vegetables. </p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1571917411767-20545014a0bc?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8Mnx8YmFuaCUyMG1pfGVufDB8fDB8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1400&q=60" alt="" /></span>
							<p>One of the most popular and easily accessible Viet foods is Banh Mi, referring to the fusion of French baguette bread and Vietnamese ingredients. The history of this dish ties back to the mid 19th century when Vietnam was under French colonial rule and French people brought over baguettes, often eating them with butter, cheese, etc. When the French rule ended, Vietnamese people began replacing butter with seasoned mayonnaise, and added pickled vegetables, cilantro, chilis, and different types of meat. Now this iconic Vietnamese sandwich often consists of: crispy and airy French baguette, Vietnamese steamed pork rolls, pickled carrots and daikon, veggies like cucumber, cilantro, and jalapenos, along with other condiments such as pate, butter, mayonnaise and soy sauce. The result is one that is a cheap and delicious staple food all over Vietnam. </p>

							<p>Perhaps a less common Vietnamese street dish is Bánh Tráng Nướng, often called the Vietnamese pizza consisting of grilled rice paper layered with oils, sauces, scallions, eggs, sausages and/or pork belly, along with other other crunchy toppings. I distinctly remember being drawn in by the delicious smell of the vendor's carts on my way home from school. While this food is often eaten by kids rather than adults, the memories of eating this dish along with friends or family draws me into it each time I go back to my home country. This tasty snack is the perfect combination of crispy, savory, and delicious.</p>

							<p>Starting with my birth place, Ho Chi Minh is a bustling city that lives with the constant hum of motorcycles and people going on with their lives. When my sister-in-law visited in 2016, the one word she chose when I asked her to describe the city was “chaotic.” This city is a visual sensory overload, with something new to offer at each head turn. Walking around the city, I can recall the swarm of motorcycles weaving through and around each other. There are rows of small businesses and vendors that line the streets of the city, with people constantly walking in and out and motorcycles pulling away. At night there is an abundance of food stands selling dried squids and other junk foods, while others are selling souvenirs to tourists. Most vividly of all, I remember the twinkling, multicolored lights that decorate the trees and buildings to welcome Tet (Vietnamese Lunar New Year) along with a special yellow flower that blooms during this time of year. </p>

							<p>There are still so many wonders and sights of Vietnam I have yet to explore. Ha Long Bay is a breathtaking coastline with towering pillars of limestone islands and islets peeking out of the blue-green water. The translation of  “Hạ Long” means “descending dragon” because of the ancient folklore that a family of dragons was sent down by the Gods to defend the country from invaders, leaving behind emeralds that turned into islets. </p>

						<p>When I was younger, my mom would walk me from my grandma’s house in the village of Phuong Lam, to my uncle’s house that is 20 minutes away. The air is dense with the smell of fresh dew in the morning and the water of the rice paddies. The subtle scent of the sweet rice water is carried with me all the way to my uncle’s house, where it mixes with the soft floral smell of the freshly bloomed magnolia flower.</p>
						<p>Much of the people that resided in the village relied on farming to make a living, as did my uncle’s family. Walking through his fruit garden, the aroma of the different fruits all seems to waft and bleed into one another. From jackfruit to dragonfruit, guava to rambutan, the smells of these tropical fruits are individually complex and dizzying when combined all together. The next time you visit the asian supermarket, pay attention to how these tropical fruit smell, and imagine the smell of the rain and soil along with them. I especially love the smell of lychee</p>
						<p>Of all the fruits, the one that strikes most glaringly is the potent and rotten smell of durian. While often described as the most foul-smelling fruit similar to smelly sewage and dirty gym socks, the taste of the white custardy and lightly sweet flesh is almost worth enduring the smell.</p>

						<p>It’s hard to describe what Vietnam really means to me. On one hand, it’s the place where I grew up and where my childhood resides up until I moved to the States when I was nine. But I haven’t lived there since, and the longest time that I spent in my hometown was only 2 weeks in 2018. Although I feel a slight disconnect to my home country, Vietnam is warm and tender by way of the authenticity of its people. </p>
						<p>Arriving at my grandmother’s house, who passed away 5 years ago, I can feel the remnants of her spirit as I take my shoes off every time before coming into the home. I feel the warmth in my chest as my family that I haven’t seen in years came over to give me the most welcoming embrace.</p>
						<p>Walking around the city, I can feel the constant humidity and the sweat that trickles down my neck and back. I feel the comfort of the air conditioner blowing in my direction after a hot sweaty walk home from ministry. I feel the chills run through my spine when the AC gets too cold in my room. I feel the temperature of cold water that runs out of my faucet for every shower I had.
							I feel the touch of little children's hands tugging at my shirt, little butts sitting on my lap and tiny arms wrapping around my waist to play and learn. I feel my insides wake up to life with energy and love after a drink of coffee and while children are giggling when they are silly or learning something new. I felt tears well up behind my eyes when I realized the perseverance and faith of the persecuted church.
